# AlphaSurvival
AlphaSurvival was an early pet project of mine, to create a RPG Minecraft server from scratch (this would be neither the first nor last attempt to solo build a Minecraft network from scratch). While I've privated a lot of my old code due to a lack of language diversity, poor obedience to best practices, and a complete lack of knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and software engineering practices, I've decided to keep this repository up to serve as:

1. A public marker for how far I've come
2. A reminder for what I can do when I'm truly dedicated to it
3. A fun look into what exploration can yield.

Now, from a purely functional perspective I am not proud of this project. Using configuration files for frequently changing game values, not implementing separate files, and shirking away from complex abilities due to a fear of particle effects are just some of the major red flags about this project. However, I am certainly thankful for it. Without this utter crash course behemoth of a project I might not've pursued the career track I'm on now. So for that reason, it stays up. Just barely. At least for now.
